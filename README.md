Designed and implemented a 16-bit sequential CPU with essential components, including instruction and data memory, an ALU, a register file with four general-purpose registers, and a custom instruction set architecture supporting register-to-register and immediate operations.<br>  
Developed a Python-based assembler for assembly-to-machine code translation and provided comprehensive documentation and a user manual detailing architecture, instruction set, and simulation procedures. 


Implemented a fun little LED diagram for a sword and shield, inspired by our CPU name. In addition, we implemented a little LED matrix that displays the current instruction hex code.

**How to use assembler program:**   
Step 1: Ensure that **instruction.txt, assembler.py, and byteknight.circ** are all located in the same folder. 

Step 2: Open the **instruction.txt,** and input any instructions desired in the following format:   
			\<INSTRUCTION\> \<REG1\> \<REG2/IMMEDIATE\>  
	Where instruction is either ADD, SUB, LDR, STR, or MUL  
	Reg1 and Reg2 is a register, e.g. X0  
	Or Immediate- an integer (simm 8), e.g. 2  
Put each instruction in a new line if you would like to have multiple instructions		

Step 3: Save the file. 

Step 4: Open and run **assembler.py**

Step 5: in the folder, there will be an **image.txt** file generated that contains the necessary hexadecimal that you need to put into the **.circ** file

Step 6: Open the .**circ** file and then simulate the CPU. Click the simulation tab and press reset simulation and then make sure auto-tick is enabled from the same tab. Right click the ROM labeled **Instruction Memory** and load the **image.txt** file. Make sure you load it as **v3.0 hex**. Next, press simulate to run the clock. 

![Hex File Format](https://github.com/vinrran/ByteKnight/blob/main/hexfileformat.jpg?raw=true)

The CPU has **4 general purpose registers: X0, X1, X2, X3**. These registers are identified using **2 bit binary representations**:  
**X0**: 00  
**X1**: 01  
**X2**: 10  
**X3**: 11

The CPU supports the following instructions:  
**ADD**: Adds two registers or a register and an immediate value  
**SUB**: Subtracts one register or immediate value from another register  
**MUL**: Multiplies two registers or a register and immediate value  
**LDR**: Loads data from memory into a register with offset  
**STR**: Stores data from a register into memory with offset

**ADD**  
With Immediate:  
ADD \<DST\_REG\> \<REG1\> \<IMM (simm8)\>  
*ADD Rd Rn Imm*

Without Immediate:  
ADD \<DST\_REG\> \<REG1\> \<REG2\>  
*ADD Rd Rn Rm*

**SUB**  
With Immediate:  
SUB \<DST\_REG\> \<REG1\> \<IMM (simm8)\>  
*SUB Rd Rn Imm*

Without Immediate:  
SUB \<DST\_REG\> \<REG1\> \<REG2\>  
*SUB Rd Rn Rm*

**MUL**  
With Immediate:  
MUL \<DST\_REG\> \<REG1\> \<IMM (simm8)\>  
*MUL Rd Rn Imm*

Without Immediate:  
MUL \<DST\_REG\> \<REG1\> \<REG2\>  
*MUL Rd Rn Rm*

**LDR**  
LDR \<TARGET\_REG\> \<REG1\> \<OFFSET (simm8)\>  
*LDR Rt Rn offset*

**STR**  
STR \<TARGET\_REG\> \<REG1\> \<OFFSET (simm8)\>  
*STR Rt Rn offset*

*If there is no offset, a value of 0 is needed.*

**Each instruction is 16 bits wide. Here is the breakdown of the bitstring:**  
**Bit Organization:**   
6-Bit Opcode: 15-10  
	\* Bit 11 is a space holder  
ALU Opcode: 9-6  
Reg2 or Immediate: 5-4  
Reg1: 3-2  
Destination/Target Register: 1-0

| Instruction | Opcode | ALU Opcode |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ADD | 110100 | 0000 |
| SUB | 110001 | 0001 |
| LDR | 11000 | 0000 |
| STR | 001001 | 0000 |
| MUL | 110100 | 0010 |

16 bits are used in this CPU. Two bits are necessary per each register and immediate input, Four are used for the ALU output.
